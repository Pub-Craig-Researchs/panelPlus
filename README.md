##panelPlus##

*panelPlus* is an enhanced econometric library built upon the foundation of *A Panel Data Toolbox for MATLAB*. It aims to extend the original toolbox's capabilities by integrating modern machine learning techniques and robust estimation methods.

#Key Enhancements#
Refructured Architecture: Reorganized all core functions into three intuitive modules: Time Series, Machine Learning, and Causal Inference.

Advanced Econometric Methods:

Double Debiased Machine Learning (DDML): For high-dimensional nuisance parameter handling.

Panel FGLS: Feasible Generalized Least Squares for handling non-spherical error structures.

Two-way Clustering: Provides robust standard errors clustered by both entity and time.

Causal Forest: Implementation of Generalized Random Forests for heterogeneous treatment effects.

Performance & Modernization: Optimized existing routines for better compatibility with recent MATLAB versions.

Note: This project was developed with technical assistance from Claude AI to ensure code efficiency and structural integrity.
